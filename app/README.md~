GOAL MANAGER

* A "goal" may have "alternative" solutions
* An "alternative" is composed by one or more sub"goals"

- A goal is completed if (at least) an alternative is completed
- An alternative is completed if all the subgoals are completed

goal = 
	{ 
	  name,
	  description,
	  achieved (boolean),
	  from_alternative (null for top level goals)
	}
alternative = 
	{
	  description,
	  subgoals (num of subgoals),
	  achSubgoals (num of achieved subgoals)
	}


* No cycles allowed: When a goal is selected as a subgoal for an alternative of a goal, there must be checked if the same goal is not a higher level goal in the same chain.
* Dynamic completion check: When all subgoals from an alternative are completed, the alternative also is put as completed, and thus also the upper level goal is. The state is propagate upwards.
